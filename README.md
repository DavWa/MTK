## Installation

Ponte is a node.js application, so it needs [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
to run. The currently recommended version is node 4.3.1, which is the Longtime Support Version. Ponte is tested against versions 0.12, 4.3.1 and 5. *Attention: you should currently not use ponte with node 5.7*

```
$ npm install ponte bunyan -g
$ ponte -v | bunyan
```
